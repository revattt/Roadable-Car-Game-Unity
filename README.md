#Rope & Magnet Pickup System â€“ Flying Car Feature

This system simulates a deployable physics based rope with a magnet at the end, allowing the flying car to pick up and drop physical objects in the world.

##Features

- **Deployable Rope Chain**  
  Press G to spawn a rope made of connected segments (rigidbodies + hinge joints) hanging from the aircraft.

- **Magnet **  
  At the end of the rope is a magnet that detects and attaches to objects tagged Pickup using a fixed joint.

- **Retract System**  
  Press H to fully retract the rope and remove the magnet.

- **Pickup & Drop**  
  If the magnet is holding an object, press J to drop it. This breaks the joint and detaches the object from the magnet.
